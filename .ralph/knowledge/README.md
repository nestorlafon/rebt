# Knowledge Base

This directory contains learnings, patterns, and insights discovered by Ralph's AI agents during development.

## File Naming Convention

Use descriptive kebab-case names with a topic prefix:

- `testing-flaky-ci.md`
- `go-error-handling.md`
- `react-state-patterns.md`

## Tagging Format

Add a Tags line at the top of each file to enable search:

```
## Tags: testing, ci, go
```

## Usage

AI agents search this directory for relevant context before starting work and write new files when they discover patterns, fix recurring mistakes, or learn from feedback.
